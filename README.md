ofxProjectorControl
============

Basic interface for Vivitek DU978-WT projectors (it probably works in all DX977, DH976, DU978 series of projectors but hasn't been tested) to activate 3D, select 3D mode, activate 3D Synce Invert and close projector.

It uses RS232 command control for LAN/RJ45 interface.
